DESCRIPTION
    This is the core session object, you probably want to look at
    Plack::Middleware::Session, unless you are writing your own session
    middleware component.

METHODS
    new ( $env )
        The constructor takes a PSGI request env hash reference.

    id  This is the accessor for the session id.

  Session Data Management

    normal hash.

    get ( $key )
    set ( $key, $value )
    remove ( $key )
    keys
    session, dump

  Session Lifecycle Management
