Revision history for Perl extension Plack::Middleware::Session

0.09_02 Sat Jan 30 23:13:50 PST 2010
    - Fixed a bug in Cookie serialization where it breaks the response headers
      generated by applications (tomyhero)

0.09_01 Sat Jan 30 13:39:21 PST 2010
    - Reworked the internal code and API a lot, so Session persistence
      and retrieval are handled in a more stateless way
    - INCOMPATIBLE: psgix.session is now a hash reference rather than an object.
      If you need an object like before, do:
        use Plack::Session; $session = Plack::Session->new($env);
    - Added Plack::Middleware::Session::Cookie which uses CookieStore
    - Updated Cookie handling code to work with Plack 0.99 and later

    * Plack::Middleware::Session
      - change plack.session to psgix.session (plack.session is
        retained for back-compat, but is deprecated and will be
        removed in future versions)

    * Plack::Session::Store::File
      - changed to lock_* versions of the Storaable functions
        (thanks to Miyagawa)
